						<p>
							I am an Aerospace Engineering graduate student at the University of Naples “Federico II”. <br>
							My university studies have given me the opportunity to improve my knowledge in various areas of Aerospace Engineering, including fluid dynamics, aircraft and space engineering. During these academic years, I realised the importance of interdisciplinarity and tried to combine the cultural background gained during my studies with the most used programming languages such as MATLAB and Python. Working on my bachelor thesis, I had also the opportunity to experience an in-depth insight into the field of Aerospace Materials Engineering, proposing solutions based on the use of machine learning and deep learning algorithms for problems related to thermal spray technologies. <br>

								<h2>Turbulence</h2>
									<h5 style="color:rgb(0, 61, 120)"> Abstract</h5>
									<p>
										This project was realized as a direct outcome of a highly insightful “Turbulence” course led by Professor Gianluca Iaccarino, Director of the Institute for Computational Mathematical Engineering at Stanford University. Through this project, I aimed to delve deeper into the nuances of various numerical techniques that are associated with turbulent models, with a special focus on wall bounded problems. 
										The main aim was the analysis of turbulent channel flow using various computational methods and turbulence models. The focus is on understanding flow characteristics and velocity profiles in a channel with parallel plates. 
										The project begins with the implementation of a Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) model to simulate turbulent flow and calculate mean velocity profiles. A specific case of channel flow, driven by a uniform pressure gradient and subject to periodic boundary conditions, is discussed.
										Furthermore, a Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) analysis is conducted using data from the Johns Hopkins Turbulence Databases (JHTDB). The simulation, performed with MATLAB, examines a sub-area of the x-z plane, revealing turbulent flow structures called "streaks." The results include 3D isosurface representations and Reynolds stress normal plots. 
										Additionally, the project explores turbulent channel flow using Ansys Fluent software. Various turbulence models, such as κ-ε models and a user-defined function (UDF) model, are implemented. The report also addresses the impact of mesh density on result quality, highlighting the importance of the computational grid. 
										By combining these analyses, this project offers a comprehensive understanding of turbulent channel flow, encompassing RANS modeling, DNS analysis, and Ansys Fluent simulations with different turbulence models.

									<h2>Space Experiments</h2>
									<h4>Space Station Espresso Cup</h4>
									<h5 style="color:rgb(0, 61, 120)"> Abstract</h5>
									<p>
										Once on the ISS, astronauts must completely change their habits. Even an action as simple as drinking a glass of water can be difficult. 
										From March to June 2022, we designed and implemented an experiment conducted under microgravity conditions to analyze the characteristics of the "Space Cup," the cup specially designed for astronauts. 
										We performed the experiments via a parabolic flight that allowed us to roughly simulate the microgravity environment, and then performed CFD analyses to corroborate the data obtained.

								<h2>Bacherlor's Thesis</h2>
								<h4>Optimisation of Cold Gas
									Dynamic Spray Technology based
									on Machine Learning Algorithms</h4>
									<h5 style="color:rgb(0, 61, 120)"> Abstract</h5>
									<p>
										Recently, many companies involved in the aircraft and aerospace sector have
										discovered new ways to implement into the production chain the many advantages
										of Cold Spray technology. It is possible to easily and smoothly repair
										metal structure by layering thick coating or to improve the properties
										of composite materials. The main problem of this technology is the prediction of
										the gas dynamic critical velocity that is strictly linked with the deposition
										efficiency. It has been observed that FEM models are hard to design
										and tedious when the boundary conditions change; hence, it is fundamental
										to find other solutions. During the last decade, the disruptive potential of
										Deep Learning algorithms has encouraged many researchers to implement
										artificial neural network even in industrial processes. This thesis has the
										purpose to propose a new approach that, with the right amount of usable
										data, could lead to a severe performance improvement to nowadays spraying
										machine.<br>

								<h2>Structural Analysis Lab</h2>
								<h4>Design and Finite Element Analysis of a
									Piper Warrior II Wing</h4>
									<h5 style="color:rgb(0, 61, 120)"> Abstract</h5>
									<p>
										In this paper a modelling and subsequent finite element analysis of a Piper Warrior
										II aircraft wing is presented. The structure consists of seven ribs, four pairs of spars with differen cross-sections and the skin. For this report, the manufacturer’s choice to use aluminium 7075 - T6 as the material for the skin was respected. The finite element analysis aims (FEM) to analyse the response of the wing to an aerodynamic pressure stress. In order to optimize the airfoil design, it was decided to compare the results in the case of a symmetrical airfoil and manufacturer’s ones,
										which instead foresees the assembly of airfoils. The analysis and modelling of the wing profiles
										was carried out using a Python script which, taking into account the regulations in force, generates
										the profile curve given the reference chord. The Airfoil library is also able to predict not only the
										behaviour of an isolated profile but also of an infinite wing. It would then be possible not only to
										study the induced resistance of the wing but also to construct its polar and analyse the distribution
										of lift along the wingspan. <br>

									<h4>Dimensionamento di un cassone
										alare per un Beechcraft Bonanza
										G-36</h4>
									<h5 style="color:rgb(0, 61, 120)"> Abstract</h5>
									<p>
										La <em>Certification Specification</em> dell’EASA che identifica gli standard sull’aeronavigabilità
										dei velivoli appartenenti alle categorie normal, utility, aerobatic e commuter
										prende il nome di CS - 23. Questa normativa prevede tutte le procedure di certificazione
										di tutti gli aeroplani delle categorie sopraccitate con un numero di posti pari
										o minore a 9, con un peso massimo al decollo di 5670 kg e con una velocità di stallo
										massima di 61 kts. Al fine di redigere questo elaborato è stato scelto come velivolo
										di riferimento il  <em>Beechcraft Bonanza G-36</em> per il quale si analizzerà la procedura per
										il dimensionamento del cassone alare. Pertanto, l’intento è quello di individuare le
										condizioni critiche di flessione, torsione e taglio e determinare se il cassone alare
										ne supera la prova. L’analisi finale sarà quindi il risultato di una serie di step successivi.
										Il primo compito è quello di determinare l’inviluppo di volo che è specifico
										per ogni velivolo. In seconda battuta, al fine di ottenere le sollecitazioni massime e
										critiche, sarà necessario specificare i carichi effettivi a cui l’ala risulta essere sottoposta.
										Sarà quindi possibile individuare i flussi di taglio e le sollecitazioni normali
										agenti sugli elementi del nostro cassone alare. <br>

									<h5 style="color:rgb(0, 61, 120)"> Abstract</h5>
									
									<p>
										In this paper a CEA analysis of the VINCI engine is presented. Vinci is the most recent
										generation of cryogenic upper-stage engines for space launch launchers.It contributes significantly
										to Ariane’s performance, sending a payload of 10.5 tonnes to GTO in the Ariane 64 version while
										allowing the development of optimized injection techniques for all Ariane 6 flights. It’s intended
										to be simple to put together and use. ArianeGroup is developing it in collaboration with European
										partners as part of an ESA initiative.. Using the data available on ESA website, it was possible
										to evaluate the ideal operating condition for the engine. Further more, the output results of the
										software have been compared to the theoretical ones. <br>

									<h5>Identification of the OF value for
										maximising the specific impulse of the
										BT-4 Cygnus engine</h5>
									<h5 style="color:rgb(0, 61, 120)"> Abstract</h5>
									
									<p>
										In this paper a CEA analysis of the BT-4 Cygnus engine is presented. IHI Aerospace
										of Japan designed and built the BT-4, a pressure-fed liquid rocket engine. The engine uses
										Monomethylhydrazine fuel and a Nitrogen Tetroxide Oxidizer to produce 450 N of thrust. The
										propellants are kept in spherical tanks that are helium-pressured. The aim of this project is to
										evaluate the best mixing ratio to optimise the specific impulse developed by the BT-4 Cygnus.
										Attention is also drawn to the comparison between the case of efflux from the nozzle in equilibrium
										and frozen or frozen efflux in the divergent section of the nozzle. <br>
